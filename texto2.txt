Hello! This morning, I saw the beautiful sun near the mountain.
The boy and the girl played a game with their dog and cat.
They were happy because their clever friend drank water and ate good food.
I love the colour of the river and the flavour of the day.
We walked together, and it was a nice moment.
He is smart, but she is conservative.
I love my family. Have a nice day!
